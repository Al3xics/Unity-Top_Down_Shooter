# Unity : Top Down Shooter

If you want to test the game, please go to my itch.io page : [Al3xics](https://al3xics.itch.io/). Download the zip file named **"Shoot Your Boss"**, decompress, and launch the .exe file.<br>
If you want to quit the game, please press **Alt + F4**, as there is no button to quit the game (the **"escape"** button will only pause the game without an interface).<br>
<br>

This project was made in only 2 weeks, and is about **creating different AI**.<br>
5 people worked on this game (including myself).<br>
Because of a lack of time, we didn't finish all of it, so there could still be some problem.<br>
<br>

Because the project is way too large to store it on github, I will not be able to show it. So try to play the game and discover what need improvement, is well made, or badly made, ...<br>
<br>

### Have fun, and try to see the different AI we created !!
